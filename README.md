The rest API is available here:

    Base URL: https://[CI_CD_DOMAIN]

        'https://[CI_CD_DOMAIN]/functions/v1/hello' \
        --header 'Accept: */*' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

# Multi users

This README provides instructions for setting up custom basic authentication for multiple users on the self-hosted version of Supabase. Unlike the cloud version, there isn't email login functionality, but you can easily create custom basic authentication for your users by following the steps below.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to add new users to your Elestio instance:

1. Access Elestio's Dashboard:

- Navigate to your Elestio's dashboard.
- Click on the "Tools" tab.
- Then, click on the "VS Code" button.

2. Locate Configuration File:

- In the opened VS Code interface, locate the volumes>api>kong.yml file.

3. Add New User Credentials:

- Scroll down to the "Dashboard credentials" section within the kong.yml file.
- Below the existing credentials block (which typically contains placeholders like $DASHBOARD_USERNAME and $DASHBOARD_PASSWORD), add a new section for each new user you want to create.
- Each new user section should follow the format:

        - consumer: DASHBOARD
          username: <username>
          password: <password>

4. Example Configuration:

- After adding new user credentials, your kong.yml file might look like this:

        - consumer: DASHBOARD
          username: $DASHBOARD_USERNAME
          password: $DASHBOARD_PASSWORD
        - consumer: DASHBOARD
          username: user2
          password: test1234

5. Restart your stack:

- Open a new terminal window.
- Execute the following commands to restart Elestio with the updated configuration:

        docker-compose down
        docker-compose up -d
